One of my hobbies is learning the Korean language, and, like with any language, vocabulary is a very important part of
                        learning a language. One of the best ways to learn vocabulary is through spaced repetition. There is an app called Anki
                        that takes care of the spaced repetition for you to make learning things easier. In Anki, you can create decks of
                        virtual flashcards and Anki will choose which cards to show each day in order to increase long-term retention. The goal
                        of this project is to automate the process of creating Anki decks of Korean vocabulary words to help me study. I used
                        Python to scrape Naver Dictionary for the Korean words. I also used an Anki library to create and export the Anki decks.
                        This project is still a work in process, but I have already used it to generate five Anki decks totaling 1600 Korean
                        vocabulary words in seconds! I would still like to add an audio track and the Hanja for each word.
